DDD
DDD also aims to create models that are understandable by
everyone involved in the software development

why not kernel sharing?
need to share certain core concepts or functionality. but other contexts have their own unique entities and behaviors that do not overlap significantly with each other.

In other words, the User context is not dependent on the Jobs and Bids contexts, but the Jobs and Bids contexts are dependent on the User context.

This is because a Job can exist independently without any Bids, but Bids are always associated with a Job.
